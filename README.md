# What is this?

This is a game created by four first-year students at U of C. It was created as part of a group assignment.   
The game is a variation on bumper cars, incorporating real-world physics and fluid controls to make a pleasant,
albiet simple, user experience.
This game is still a work in progress.

# JavaFX version

Now with new controls:  
- WASD to move
- Q to explode
- hold E to become 'anchored' (infinite mass)
- Shift to dash in current direction
- Space to reset map. Creates new enemies, and revives you when dead.
- Escape to quit

### Creating a compiled version:

1. Double-click on the following items in the left panel:  
	1. **Braden-Manjot-Michael-Sean-Game**  
	2. **Let's Build a Game/src**  
	3. **com.tutorial.main**  
	4. **TextGame.java**  
2. Click on the green **run** button in the top-left corner.  
	It should be the first button to the right of the button that looks like a bug.
3. This should bring up a window somewhere on the screen. Click the **red square** on it.

11. **Open a command prompt window**. There are several ways to do this.  
	Refer to an Internet guide, if need be.
12. Type `java -jar filename.jar`,  
	where `filename.jar` is the export destination you copied earlier.

This should get the game running!

*To play the graphical version, follow the same instructions, but selecting* **Game**,   
*instead of* **TextGame**

Follow the in-game prompts to play.

Animation mode is a mode that may be OS specific,  
and it makes animations more fluid. If your operating system supports it,  
I highly recommend it!

**Have fun!**

### Controls for the graphical game:

- Use WASD to move around
- Press Q to explode
- Press E to become 'anchored' (unstoppable)
- Press Shift to dash
- Press Space to reset

Don't hit the walls or the obstacles! Hitting grey traps will cause strange effects!
